        <p> The original <em>Cup of Excellence</em> is an annual competition held in several countries to identify the highest
            quality coffees produced. Here at Kenzan, our Cup of Excellence is a coffee cupping competition with some of Denver's best
            micro roasters. We have sampled coffees from Boxcar, Corvus, Huckleberry, ink!, Middle State, and Sweet Bloom coffee roasters.</p>
